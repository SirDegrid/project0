# Tic Tac Toe
The classic two player game of Tic Tac Toe, online. 

## Features 
Clean and simple, the site clearly informs players whose turn it is, alerts the players when someone has won, and allows the players to start a new game at the click of a button. 

## About the Game
Turns are alternated between two players - player with mark 'X' and player with mark 'O'. A player's turn consists of marking a chosen square by clicking it on the screen. The game is won when there are three of one player's marks in a row (vertical, horizontal or diagonal). When there is a winner the game will end, players will be notified of the result, and a button will appear to start a new game when clicked.
